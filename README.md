# Economic-Forecasting-Tool
This is a Matlab program originally written by Qing Zhang for the Asian Development Bank as part of a consulting engagement. It is an automated module to make forecasts (economic or otherwise) by combining linear regressions, with weights determined by cross validation. The forecasting method is borrowed from Professor Bruce Hansen. (http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/forecast/methodology.htm)
