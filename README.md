# Economic-Forecasting-Tool
This is a Matlab program I originally wrote for the Asian Development Bank. It is an automated module to make forecasts (economic or otherwise) by combining linear regressions, with weights determined by cross validation. To facilitate use by people not comfortable with running a Matlab program, I also provide a manual and a video that explains how to run this program from MS Excel. The forecasting method is from Bruce Hansen. (http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/forecast/methodology.htm)
